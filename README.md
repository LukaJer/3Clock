Accurate Arduino Nano/ATmega328 clock by compensating for temperature drift of the oscillator. The idea is to observe the clock speed at different temperatures with an oscilloscope and getting a formula for calculating drift per Â°C. This formula will be used by the uC to adjust the timer value needed for the 0.1s or 1s interrupt. The compensated clock will then be compared to GPS-Time and its PPS interrupt.  
The Code will be written in C.
